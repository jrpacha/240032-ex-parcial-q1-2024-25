MN P2 ExParcial 1Q 2024-25
Question 3

Consider the triangular mesh meshMontseny.mat that you have available in this folder.
The mesh is from the Montseny Natural Park, with units (the positions of the nodes) in
kilometers. Consider the point P = (13.0, 1.0).

(a) (3 points) The mean of the x-component of the element containig P is:

    Sol. <x> = 1.2961e+01

    Hint. The mean of the y-component of the element containig P is: <y> = 1.0032e+00

(b) (3 points) If the point Q is the barycenter of element 4074, de distance between P
    and Q is:

    Sol. dist(P, Q) = 4.1413e+00

(c) (2 points) Let us consider the point R = (10.0,2.0). If the temperature at points P,
    Q, and R is T(P) = 18.7, T(Q) = 17.6, T(R) = 17.2, what will be the interpolated
    temperature at point S = (11.0,2.0)?

    Sol. Interpolated temperature at S: 1.7756e+01

(d) (2 points) In a book, we saw that the surface of the Natural Park is S = 310.0 km^2.
    What is the relative error of the area defined by our mesh if we take S as the true
    value?

    Sol. Relative Error = |Measured Value - True Value| / |True Value| = 2.0836e-03
